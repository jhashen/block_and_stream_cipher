You need Python 3.6 or higher. If you don't have it, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Step 2: Download the code
Download `block_cipher.py` and 'streamcipher.py' from this repository and save it to any folder on your computer.

#### Step 3: Run the code
Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the file, and run:
```bash

```

That's it! You'll see the encryption and decryption demo in action.
